8,True,PDF-file metadata: Privacy Filtering all metadata,"This pull-request pertains to the addition of metadata to PDF files associated with entries, as triggered by the menu entry ""Write XMP metadata to PDFs"" in the ""Tools"" menu. XMP is an extremely interesting feature that allows tagging PDF files (amongst others) with automatically retrievable metadata in much the same way mp3-tags allow adding title/author/... information to mp3 music files. Actually JabRef exports the metadata not only to two XMP namespaces (Dublin Core and a custom JabRef namespace), but also to the PDF DocumentInformation Object.  Practically from the beginning of the XMP-writing capabilities of JabRef, Christopher Oezbek had added _privacy filtering_ for the XMP-tagging of PDF-files with data from the bibtex-record, meaning that the user could define a list of fields (in Preferences->XMP metadata) which should _not_ be exported to the PDF file.  Unfortunately, the filtering was incomplete: jabref exports the metadata in three different forms, only one of which was originally filtered. In 2013 filtering was extended to both XMP namespaces, but JabRef still exported _all_ fields into the PDF DocumentInfo object. The two present commits correct this problem. The first (b45316f) prevents private fields from being exported to the PDF DocumentInfo. The second one more agressively erases these fields even if they already exist in the PDF document.   The deletion of existing fields might be debateable. It seems the right thing to do for fields clearly generated by JabRef (viz. those prefixed by ""jabref/""), but there are four fields which might be of other origin (Author,Title,Subject and Keywords). Making a systematic exception for these four fields, i.e. not erasing them even if they are privacy filtered, is a bad idea and violates the principle of least surprise. This is why the second commit makes no exception. Deactivating the erasure for the four generic fields could however easily be added as an option in the XMP export preferences if it is judged important. The current behaviour has the advantage of reliably correcting PDF files previously tagged with a buggy privacy filtering.  If these commits are pulled into the master branch and confirmed to work, the bug #869 on the sourceforge tracker:  https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/869/ can be closed.

Because I have lots of groups which cannot even fit into the full screen height after expansion. 3. no way to expand or collapse all nodes  I tried the dev version, all problems still exist.

42,True,Fix for bug #876: Windows 7/8/10 - Pinning Jabref to the taskbar now works,"Previously, JabRef couldn't be pinned to the taskbar ([bug report](https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/876/)). The reason is that, by wrapping JabRef with Launch4j, Windows thinks only Java is running and does not recognize JabRef as something separate.  Based on a [stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9330209/whats-the-best-way-to-start-java-applications-on-windows-7) the fix proceeds in two stages: - During the setup, we create a (dummy) shortcut and set the [Application User Model Id](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd378459%28v=vs.85%29.aspx). For this, we use the [WinShell plugin](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/WinShell_plug-in) for NSIS. - At program start, we notify Windows that this JabRef instance has the AppUserModelId specified in the setup. In order to do this, we invoke native commands using the Java Native Access (JNA) library.

Main changes are: - Create a new target based on Oracle's appbundler to create a bundle compatible with newer JVMs. (not compatible with Apple's JVM). - Move the older target to Jabref-legacy.app. - Remove the old deprecated wrapper OSXAdapter, which does not work with Oracle's JVM. - Create new wrapper based on com.apple.eawt (compatible with both JVMs). - Improve the quit behaviour. - Add support for the Fullscreen feature.  The code changes are compatible with both Oracle's JVMs and Apple legacy one, but the legacy bundle is currently broken as the code requires Java 1.7+.

This is not possible directly with `commons.logging` and requires the usage of the underlying logging API.  The major benefits are of this pull request are: - All classes use the same mechanism for logging - Many log messages have been checked and improved if possible - It is now easier to switch out the internal logging implementation  ",2015-07-29T09:06:19Z,2015-07-29T12:25:54Z,lenhard,Joerg Lenhard,24a194fc8ce20bf58e8f1ab6bf785709d2b33127,src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/RightClickMenu.java,24a194fc8ce20bf58e8f1ab6bf785709d2b33127,org.apache.commons.logging.Log,,Logging,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It uses an additional `.mailmap` file to merge different name/email configurations of unique authors. The list is in sync with the old manual list from `About.html`. Missing manual entries are concatenated in `scripts/generate-authors.sh`for now.  Imho, we should either skip missing authors, or map them to unmapped commit emails. I'm not sure how many commits are missing in our history and in which way these people contributed. Maybe @koppor can shed some light on this.  The idea is to use this file to replace our contributors list inside `About.html` automatically without losing contributor's information or being inconsistent between languages etc. We may have to do some changes to the file structure, e.g. attribute _name_ only, but this PR is mainly for unifying our data first.  The script itself `scripts/generate-authors.sh` can either be included in the build process or executed manually at times, as it may be beneficial if we oversee the mapping process by a human.

89,True,Removes splash screen,"This PR removes both the splash screen and the CLI option to disable the splash screen.   Why? - splash screen on modern systems is shown only for a very short period of time as JabRef starts fast - we should focus on making JabRef to start as fast as possible. A splash screen reduces the time to start the software as additional code needs to be executed.  - for each new version (even for beta and dev versions), we have to check in a png with 200KB file size into the repository. This increases the amount of storage required for the git repository by 200KB for each version/dev-version. - The splash screen interferes with using JabRef via the CLI.  - It reduces code in JabRef. Hence, less code needs to be maintained.  This is a PR that is open for discussion. Please add any pros/cons as you see fit.

109,True,[WIP] Rewrite and test layout formatter,"# Rationale 1. The layout formatter feature is a bit hidden and it is unclear how many people really use this feature. 2. The feature is complex to use 3. Some of the formatters should be a) integrated as default auto formatters b) removed because they really don't make a lot of sense. 4. Most license problems are caused by these classes. # List  > - **Authors** : this formatter provides formatting options for the author and editor fields; for detailed information, see below. It deprecates a range of dedicated formatters provided in versions of JabRef prior to 2.7. > - **CreateBibORDFAuthors** : formats authors for according to the requirements of the Bibliographic Ontology (bibo). > - **CreateDocBookAuthors** : formats the author field in DocBook style. > - **CreateDocBookEditors** : formats the editor field in DocBook style. > - **CurrentDate**: outputs the current date. With no argument, this formatter outputs the current date and time in the format ""yyyy.MM.dd hh:mm:ss z"" (date, time and time zone). By giving a different format string as argument, the date format can be customized. E.g. \format[CurrentDate]{yyyy.MM.dd} will give the date only, e.g. 2005.11.30. > - Default : takes a single argument, which serves as a default value. If the string to format is non-empty, it is output without changes. If it is empty, the default value is output. For instance, \format[Default(unknown)]{\year} will output the entry's year if set, and ""unknown"" if no year is set. >  > **DOIStrip**: strips any prefixes from the DOI string.  Should be automatically integrated as sensible default!  > **DOICheck** : provides the full url for a DOI link.  DOICheck as name makes no sense. Rename at least to DOILink.  > - FileLink(filetype) : if no argument is given, this formatter outputs the first external file link encoded in the field. To work, the formatter must be supplied with the contents of the ""file"" field. >   This formatter takes the name of an external file type as an optional argument, specified in parentheses after the formatter name. For instance, \format[FileLink(pdf)]{\file} specifies pdf as an argument. When an argument is given, the formatter selects the first file link of the specified type. In the example, the path to the first PDF link will be output. > - FirstPage : returns the first page from the ""pages"" field, if set. For instance, if the pages field is set to ""345-360"" or ""345--360"", this formatter will return ""345"". > - FormatChars : This formatter converts LaTeX character sequences their equicalent unicode characters and removes other LaTeX commands without handling them. > - FormatPagesForHTML : replaces ""--"" with ""-"". > - FormatPagesForXML : replaces ""--"" with an XML en-dash. > - GetOpenOfficeType : returns the number used by the OpenOffice.org bibliography system (versions 1.x and 2.x) to denote the type of this entry. > - HTMLChars : replaces TeX-specific special characters (e.g. {^a} or {\""{o}}) with their HTML representations, and translates LaTeX commands \emph, \textit, \textbf into HTML equivalents. > - HTMLParagraphs : interprets two consecutive newlines (e.g. \n \n) as the beginning of a new paragraph and creates paragraph-html-tags accordingly. > - IfPlural : outputs its first argument if the input field looks like an author list with two or more names, or its second argument otherwise. E.g. \format[IfPlural(Eds.,Ed.)]{\editor} will output ""Eds."" if there is more than one editor, and ""Ed."" if there is only one. > - JournalAbbreviator : The given input text is abbreviated according to the journal abbreviation lists. If no abbreviation for input is found (e.g. not in list or already abbreviated), the input will be returned unmodified. For instance, when using \format[JournalAbbreviator]{\journal}, ""Physical Review - Letters"" gets ""Phys. Rev. Lett."" > - LastPage : returns the last page from the ""pages"" field, if set. For instance, if the pages field is set to ""345-360"" or ""345--360"", this formatter will return ""360"". > - NoSpaceBetweenAbbreviations : LayoutFormatter that removes the space between abbreviated First names. Example: J. R. R. Tolkien becomes J.R.R. Tolkien. > - NotFoundFormatter : Formatter used to signal that a formatter hasn't been found. This can be used for graceful degradation if a layout uses an undefined format. > - Number : outputs the 1-based sequence number of the current entry in the current export. This formatter can be used to make a numbered list of entries. The sequence number depends on the current entry's place in the current sort order, not on the number of calls to this formatter. >  > **RemoveBrackets** : removes all curly brackets ""{"" or ""}"".  This just removes **all** brackets without checking for escape sequences or such, e.g. {.  > **RemoveBracketsAddComma**: removes all curly brackets ""{"" or ""}"". The closing curly bracket is replaced by a comma.  I don't see any use case where I want to do this. - RemoveLatexCommands : removes LaTeX commands like \em, \textbf, etc. If used together with HTMLChars or XMLChars, this formatter should be called last.  > **RemoveTilde**: replaces the tilde character used in LaTeX as a non-breakable space by a regular space. Useful in combination with the NameFormatter discussed in the next section. >  > **RemoveWhitespace**: removes all whitespace characters.  Where would this make any sense?  > - Replace(regexp,replacewith) : does a regular expression replacement. To use this formatter, a two-part argument must be given. The parts are separated by a comma. To indicate the comma character, use an escape sequence: \,   The first part is the regular expression to search for. Remember that any commma character must be preceded by a backslash, and consequently a literal backslash must be written as a pair of backslashes.

162,True,[WIP] Improvements to search,"This is a new version of my old pull request, now updated to the 2.8 version and incorporating all the suggestions from the last time. (Except the clean commit history )  The changes include: - Search bar is now at the top - Autocompletion suggestions are shown in a popup - Search options are available via a drop-down list, this implements Feature Request #853 - ""Clear search"" button also clears search field, this implements Feature Request #601 - In incremental search mode: next result is selected by pressing enter (instead of Control + F as previously) - Incremental search now uses the same search engine as the other search modes - Added a new search mode (Live filter) which filters the table as soon as the search text is changed  I have a few questions: - ~~There are quite a few changes from formatting the code in Eclipse. Is it ok if I include them?~~ - I have a problem with listening to changes in the textfield and programatically setting the text with setText(). The latter command triggers first an event for the deletion of the text and then another one for inserting the new one. Is there a way to be informed just once about such a change? (This occours in the following case: if the user accepts an autocompletion, then the text is changed via setText(). Thus, in incremental and live filter mode, two searches are performed.) - ~~The SearchWorker implemented the AbstractWorker interface. As far as I understood, this enables one to do work asynchronously and then change the GUI later. However, the worker is simply run via        worker.getWorker().run();       worker.getCallBack().update();   In my understanding, this defeats completely the purpose of using the AbstractWorker. What is the right way to run it?~~ - ~~A general observation about the `SearchRule` class. Every method of it takes the query as an argument. I would propose to save the query internally in  `SearchRule` and thus simplify the interface a little bit.~~ - ~~The setting ""Autocomplete names"" is not yet implemented.

175,True,Increase saving speed,"Intended to fix #122, this PR turned into a major API change. It replaces `String[]` in the return types of `BibtexEntryType` with `List<String>`. This allows to return immutable lists instead of mutable arrays and improves the stability of the program. Additionally, the rewrite allowed to replace a lot of duplicate object creation with instance variables.  With respect to #122, the immutability of the new lists removes the necessity to create defensive copies and therefore avoids a lot of cloning.

218,True,AbstractPushToApplication,"Here's my go at an AbstractPushToApplication class. So far I've implemented PushToTexmaker.java using the new class. See the last commit, the earlier commit is primarily refactoring all these files to external.push.  Comments so far? I thought it might be a better idea to get some input on the construction of the abstract class before I continue converting the rest.  The abstract class will work ""out of the box"" if there's just a single path to be set. In that case one will have to define the four methods in PushToTexmaker: name, icon, command line, and an init, primarily meant to get the preference key (maybe better to have a `getPreferenceKey()`?

I would have expected it to be turned off as default. (I reset my preferences and started a vanilla JabRef"". - [x] Remove debug output - [x] ESC should leave the search and focus the currently selected entry - [x] I pressed `CTRL+f` multiple times. The view changed (behavior due to old JabRef behavior, I would like to have that removed).  - [x] Further, I cannot switch back from ""Filter"" to ""Float"". Have to restart JabRef. Steps: ""Float"" is activated. Search for a string where you can see the floated area. Switch to ""Filter"". OK. Switch back to ""Float"": Nothing happens. After a restart, float works as usual. - [x] Preview is broken in combination with the new search. When switching from ""Float"" to ""Fitler"" and back: The preview panel constantly updates and the empty area above the entry grows and grows. However, this is a separate issue. --> fixed as this was a larger concurrency issue as a lot of code was NOT executed on the Swing EDT... - [ ] Search is not aware of currently active groups. Hence, the displayed search results (found x matches) may be strange to the user when no entries are shown at all. - [x] When the advanced search is active, the search icon on the left is marked red.  - [x] CRITICAL Focus is lost from the search window sometimes as the entry editor can grab the focus in some cases.

Especially to figure out if the wrapping may not be needed in all places and if there actually should be wrapping where there currently isn't.  A better option would be to explicitly lock and unlock the tables, but that require much more work.

379,True,Add tests for the Bibtex parser,"I added a few tests for the Bibtex parser. I appreciate your feedback about the following points. - [x] Please have a look at the `TODO` comments. These concern string concatenation and `@String` fields. For example in `parseRecognizesDateFieldWithConcatenation` the field `date = {1-4~} # nov` is parsed as `1-4~#nov#`. I wouldn't have expect the last sharp symbol. - [x] Tests about JabRef's metadata (groups etc.) are still missing. Mostly, because I don't know the specifications :). Maybe in a new PR. - [x] Related to the previous point, the `GUIGlobals.META_FLAG` flags should be moved to another place (they are not GUI, but parser/writer logic). What would be an appropriate new home for them? - [x] There are 4 tests at the end of the file starting with `test`. These tests fail (without the `@Ignore` tag) but I'm not sure what they test and what would be the expected behavior in these cases. - [x] There are quite a few ignored tests. These are related to open bugs in SF or are new bugs which I found while writing the tests (nothing big). I will open a new issue for the new bugs after this PR is merged.  For the record: While going through the code, I also changed the following things: - Remove `BibtexParser.isRecognizedFormat` since the code has quite a few shortcomings (whitespace before @ or closing brackets on new lines were a problem) and the execution was quite slow for big files - Fixed a bug where loading a file with corrupted bibtex entries showed an exception, cf. `parseIgnoresAndWarnsAboutCorruptedEntry()` - Made `EntryType` an abstract class which implements the `Comparable` interface and overwrites `equals(Object other)`. Thus new expressions like `entry.getType() == BibtexEntryTypes.ARTICLE` return the expected result.

391,True,Write unmodified entries to bib file in the same format as they were read,"As discussed in #116, we want to write entries that are not modified during a session back in the exact same format as they were read. This PR is WIP in this direction and not complete yet. I will continue working on it.  To be able to write back an entry in the same fashion as it is read, we need to store it upon reading. I added a field to `BibtexEntry` for storing this and tried to modify `BibtexParser` to store the file content, but to no avail. The current code of that class is pure hell (uses a global `PushBackReader` to read the file in a very confusing way) and this PR is hopefully a step towards its replacement.  Instead of modifying the logic in `BibtexParser`, I extend it with additional methods that perform the new functionality on top. Current status: 1. On initialization the complete file is read into a `List<String>` of its lines before handing it over to the old parser. 2. After an entry has been parsed, the original represenation of the entry is looked up in the `List<String>` and stored in the entry. Blank lines following the entry belong to the entry.  ~~That means we read the file twice, which is terrible for large files, but as this is WIP...~~  Next step will be to detect when an entry has been changed and the modification of the writing logic.  The handling of newlines currently is not consistent.

403,True,Force to have at least english localization,"What has been done: - [x] Cleanup python script - [x] Localization keys no longer contain trailing/leading spaces and newlines.

Hence, the workaround to disable the formatter is no longer required. - [x] If the unit test fails, on the console the appropriate measures are printed how to add the keys.  - [x] Fixed a lot of other issues as well, e.g., when the exception message was part of the localization key.  - [x] That all non-english property files have the same keys as the english property file is checked by the unit test. However, there is also gradle task/python script for this. - [x] Unit test that checks that every english translation is equal to the key.  - POSTPONE `<br>` is similar to `\n`, but for this we do not have checks yet as well. - POSTPONE Rename `Localization.lang` to `Localization.message` - [x] The KeyBindings use `Localization.lang` directly. - [x] Refactored code of KeyBinding - [x] update documentation - [x] if any resource bundle is not available or if the given locale is not known or if the resource bundles have not bin initialized, always use ""en"" language.   This is good for a review. The remaining points I would like to ignore as this is really annoying work, and this should be good enough with this PR already.   New process: 1. Add new Localization.lang(""KEY"") to Java file. 2. Tests fail. In the test output a snippet is generated which must be added to the english translation file. There is also a snippet generated for the non-english files, but this is irrelevant. 3. Add snippet to english translation file 4. With `gradlew -b localization.gradle compareAndUpdateTranslationsWithEnglishTranslation` the ""KEY"" is added to the other translation files as well.  5. Tests are green again.

468,True,Improved duplicate checker,"I changed the core function of the duplicate checker from correlation to approximate string matching. This enables the test to work (which earlier failed as `Bob` and `Joyce` was deemed as close enough to indicate a duplicate...). Probably some of the constants used for comparison needs to be tuned. Also, as the approximate string matching is based on edit distance (the number of edits required to turn one string into the other), it might be that one may operate the complete comparison on the full string rather than the word by word style as currently is used.  I think this is good to go (in the sense that it probably performs better than the previous), but please check it with a few different databases to make sure that the false positives or missing hits are to frequent.

501,True,[WIP] Prototype for new EntryType interface,"This is a prototype for an idea to resolve the issues discussed in #337 and #495.  Right now the entry type is converted from a string representation (in the bibtex file) to an EntryType by the parser. The problem with this approach is that the parser has to know about the bibtex vs biblatex mode. The idea was to add an intermediate step: String (in Bibtex file) -> EntryClass (by parser) -> EntryType (by some factory using information from the preferences) - There is an enum `StandardEntryClass` holding all the standard types regardless of bibtex or biblatex (so article, mvbook, etc, all are there). To support also unknown entry types we have the class `NonStandardEntryClass`. So for example, parsing `@article{}` results in `class = StandardEntryClass.ARTICLE` while `@gibberish{}` yields `class = NonStandardEntryClass` with name `gibberish`. In this way the type information is stored in a relative convenient form (better then a string).  The idea of an enum implementing an interface was taken from the way java handles standard file locations. See [the oracle blog ](https://blogs.oracle.com/darcy/entry/enums_and_mixins) (or [another blog](http://blog.pengyifan.com/how-to-extend-enum-in-java/)). - The `EntryClass` does not know about required and optional fields. These information are provided by the `EntryTypeFactory`. For example, `entryTypeFactory(prefs).getTypeFor(StandardEntryClass.ARTICLE).getRequiredFields()` gives the required fields.   Please ignore all the ""my"" prefixes in the class names.

542,True,[WIP] Refactor cleanup code,"I moved the rest of the logic in `CleanupAction` to its new home `CleanupWorker`. This change should make it very easy to run cleanup operations at other points (for example after import).

The dialog refers to ""selected words""? which ones? - Html to Latex: `<b>hallo</b>` to `""\\textbf{hallo}""`?  These are my expectations, but in fact all of them are wrong as failing tests show.

572,True,Refactor cleanup code,"This PR (again) refactors the cleanup department. The motivation was to extract as much logic as possible from the cleanup action to make it easier to use cleanup operations also at different points (like on save).  Biggest changes: - Move preferences controlling the cleanup process to own data class `CleanupPreset` and the execution of the cleanup process to `CleanupWorker`. Thus starting a cleanup process is reduced to setting up a proper preset and passing it to the worker. - Move code displaying and changing a preset to a separate class. Hence it is now easy to show and change a preset at a different place (like in the preferences).  - Move preferences code to `JabRefPreferences`. Well, this is the place where it belongs. - Add tests for the `CleanupWorker`. More detailed tests of the different cleanup processes are still missing.  Todo's/Breaking changes: These are all related to the fact that there is no nice interface to get/set the file field of an entry (all the code is in the gui class FileListTableModel). - The counting of unsuccessful renames does not work anymore (I vote for removing this completely) - Remove CleanupUtil and incorperate the code in the respective cleanup classes. Currently this code relies on gui code (FileListTableModel) and thus cannot easily be moved to logic. - Test the file related cleanups.

602,True,Major OpenOffice changes,"Assuming that the current state of the OpenOffice/LibreOffice connection is good enough (and that no one will improve it significantly in the near future), this PR removes currently unused code.  The major removed thing (from some perspective) is the .bst-support. However, as far as I can tell, it wasn't finished (and therefore not enabled) and while I really think it is a nice feature, I cannot really imagine someone finishing it.  As a second change, the push-to-application button support is removed and only the side panel can be used (which is much more advanced anyway). There are probably further things that can be removed, such as a few preferences related to push-to-application, but that will require further analysis.  This PR builds on #601, so merging that first is probably the best (and this may require some thinking).

605,True,Change EntryType to String in BibEntry,This PR tries to resolve the issues discussed in #337 and #495.  Right now the entry type is converted from a string representation (in the bibtex file) to an EntryType by the parser. The problem with this approach is that the parser has to know about the bibtex vs biblatex mode.

To support file sharing, the save actions are configured in the meta data of a file as a comment, in the following syntax:  ``` @comment{jabref-meta: saveActions:title;LowerCaseChanger;} ```  This above save action applies the LowerCaseChanger for the content of every title field on save.  In the future, we need to enable the configuration of save actions via the UI in the database properties.

718,True,Improve database writer,"The aim of this PR is to improve the database writer, in particular fix #621 and #669.  Also add tests to the writer and parser (and do some refactorings to make test writing easier).  Changes (to serialization): - Fix #621 and #669 by adding new lines after encoding and preamble. The idea is that everything is terminated by a new line and the parsed serialization only safes newlines which separate it from the previous entry.  - Comments and preamble are serialized with capitalized first letter, i.e. `@Comment` instead of `@comment` and `@Preamble` instead of `@PREAMBLE`. This should follow the convention for entries. - There is no space anymore between `@String` and the bracket and after the bracket, i.e. `@String{name = {string}}` instead of `@String { name = {string} }` - Implemented [#756](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/756): Add possibility to reformat all entries on save (under Preferences, File)  Refactorings: - Renamed FileActions to BibDatabaseWriter - Merged code for export and save in BibDatabaseWriter - Extracted SaveSettings class from FileActions to own file and extended it (& renamed to SavePreferences). Note that this class has some setters (against the recently established convention for preference classes) since there are quite a few cases where the values from the preferences have to be overriden.  - Change usage of arrays to list in many places - Remove unused boolean parameters checkSearch, checkGroup - Moved writing of metadata and CustomEntryTypesManager to BibDatabaseWriter - Extracted and reused gui code for displaying and editing sort preferences (SaveOrderConfigDisplay) ",2016-01-26T18:11:13Z,2016-02-11T06:37:28Z,tobiasdiez,Tobias Diez,c510134a57b2408adca7ef5bab9dd5503fe18bc7,src/main/java/net/sf/jabref/gui/journals/AbbreviateAction.java,c510134a57b2408adca7ef5bab9dd5503fe18bc7,net.sf.jabref.model.entry.BibEntry,,Software Development and IT Operations,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

821,True,Save actions gui,"This is the first (functional) shot at integrating a GUI for configuring save actions. I think it is now time for feedback on two aspects: 1. the save action feature itself 2. the look of the GUI  Regarding 1.: Currently, any class implementing `net.sf.jabref.logic.formatter.Formatter` can be used as a save action and can be configured for a field of any non-null and non-empty name (so you can configure actions for your custom fields). That is quite flexible. It would be trivial to extend that to `net.sf.jabref.logic.cleanup.CleanupJob`. The problem with integrating cleanup actions is that a `CleanupJob` seems to represent a batch job of cleanups that are preconfigured for certain fields. It is generally not intended to execute a `CleanupJob` for a specific and selectable field. Hence, I am not sure if cleanups and save actions go well together. A downside of the current save action feature is that save actions cannot be undone (like the sorting feature).  Regarding 2.: The GUI is functional, _not_ pretty.  ![save actions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1515701/13051416/6695bd6e-d3f9-11e5-83f7-9629616b3ede.png) It has a check box to enable or disable all actions, a set of controls for adding a new action, a list for displaying actions, and a button for deleting a selected action. Do you have suggestions for a better set of controls?  Finally, the layout of the controls definitely needs improvement and for some reason the size of the controls increases when adding an action. These things need to be fixed. Alas, layouting is not my favourite task...  I would be grateful if someone takes a look at this and provides some feedback!

847,True,Refactor group package,"The main aim of this PR is to separate the groups package in gui and logic parts. To accomplish this, the following changes were made: - All the UI related code from the GroupTreeNode class is moved to a new class GroupTreeNodeViewModel, which functions as an adapter from GroupTreeNode to Swing's TreeNode class. - Add classes EntriesGroupChange and MoveGroupChange which store the changes made to the group. The corresponing UI classes UndoableChangeAssignment and UndoableMoveGroup now work as converter to Swing's AbstractUndoableEdit. - Add TreeNode class which is more a less a (typed) copy of Swing's DefaultMutableTreeNode and which contains all the logic for traversing the group tree. - Implement observer interface for changes in the group tree - Some smaller refactorings like moving method from class A to B. - Add tests for the logic classes GroupTreeNode and TreeNode  Since this PR makes quite some changes and there are no tests in place, I wouldn't merge this PR if a new version should be released the next day :smiley: . All the usual functions should work though.  For some reason github shows some of the moved files as removed + added. Locally, gitk shows a correct diff.

Is ""Firstname Lastname"" equal to ""Lastname, Firstname""? Is ""Cool and the Gang"" equal to ""Cool And The Gang""? How strict should we be?  At first, I thought, we have to be very strict. Then, I saw that our XMP utilities normalize the content of the author field for writing into the PDF.  Maybe we need a ""normalized format"" and a ""canonical representation"".

942,True,Add support for write-protected PDFs,"This PR shows how support for write-protected PDFs can be added to JabRef.  If we do not want to be a ""cryptographic"" software, I can just remove the dependency on `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.54`. Then, JabRef will compile, but throw an exception if write-protected PDFs are opened. I can adjust the test cases accordingly. ## Crypto Discussion  This fixes #935.  When importing PDFs, which carry a password for editing, both the XMP Metadata parser and the PDFContentImporter can handle this.  Now, the [Legion of the Bouncy Castle Java cryptography APIs](http://bouncycastle.org/java.html) are part of JabRef, which makes JabRef subject to export restrictions.
